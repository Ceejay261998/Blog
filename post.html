                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>Ever laid down on your bed, thinking to yourself, "Who am I? What is my purpose on coming here in this world? Is there any meaning to all of this?" Then, upon your soul-searching in an attempt to placate the unanswered questions, you remembered videos talking about the vastness of the universe, probably ending in an existential remark by the author that we are nothing compared to the universe. The existential feeling lingers, and you just set aside the questions, once again, shoved into the recesses of your mind, thinking that maybe they are not worthwhile to be answered, at least for the night.</p>
                        <p>This is an all too familiar scenario for me. Several nights in a month, especially after a stressful day, the questions will plague my mind, like little, stubborn gremlins that hold forked tridents, poking my very being with pointed edges every now and then. As if the day's toils are not enough to keep me exhausted.</p>
                        <p>I guess, as long as those questions are unanswered, the gremlins will keep visiting. And who knows. Maybe they'll torment me with upgraded weapons, drawing blood until only a little is left in me.</p>
                        <p>But maybe, just maybe, these questions should remain this way, unanswered for as long as I live.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">No Light when there is no Darkness</h2>
                        <p>I have come across upon multiple posts and videos tackling these questions. Expectedly, people have different takes on the matter. Loosely speaking, biology says we exist because our evolutionary ancestors kept surviving, evolving and evolving until their genetics gave form to us. Theology says it is due to the creative powers of a Higher Being, molding us to His same image and making us labor for all our days. Perhaps the craziest I have encountered up to date is that we are living in a hologram. To make things crazier, this theory is supported by solid and robust principles of physics.</p>
                        <p>But I thought, no matter the reason for our existence, one thing is for certain. We exist. We are conscious. We are aware not only of our surroundings, but also of ourselves. We have the capacity to feel and the ability to think. It is something that inanimate objects, no matter how grand, can never do. Humanity has a special place in the cosmos.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Afterall, we are made of stardust. And in that regard, we are the universe experiencing itself.</blockquote>
                        <p>At this very moment as I'm typing these letters, I'm thinking that I can pour my thoughts into this blog and express myself. It is in itself an exquisite experience- experience that only a human can participate.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Man against universe</h2>
                        <p>The universe is vast. Calling us a speck compared to it is a grave understatement. Yet, with all its stars, planets, galaxies, quasars, black holes, worlds without end- with all its grandeur and glory, it will never be able to look its reflection in the mirror and admire itself. It will never be capable to feel the will to keep moving forward despite the meaninglessness of it all. It will never be capable of experiencing the joys of companionship of another being, and the tranquility of solitude. It will never be able to understand itself.
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/RoadTravel.jpg" alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">My journey in this world sometimes feel meaningless. But I'm just thankful that I'm in a journey in the first place.</span>
                        <p>Thinking again about the questions, maybe it is unanswered not because it is unaswerable, but it ought not to be answered. Not at least in this lifetime. Maybe sometime in the distant future, when the events of the universe will come to a final wrap-up. A final hurrah not only to the history of the universe but of man as well. Maybe in that one grand, final event. But not now. Because if it did, my quest for existence is fulfilled, and meaning will no longer be found in continuing.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, I think, it's better I start now to make friends with the gremlins.</p>
                        <p>
